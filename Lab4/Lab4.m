AIm: COntrolled brisk rectifier for single phase 

Thyrestor instead of diodes in rectifiers 

positive cycle: T1 and T2 is on
negative cycle: T3 and T4 is on 

aplha <90 degrees -> Vout->+ve and Rectifier
alpha>90 degrees -> Vout -> -ve and inverter 
*alpha is firing angle

firing analge is 120 here 

voltage source is rms -> 230 *sq root(2)

Load voltage is output voltage
